# Private Server Configuration

⚠️ **This folder contains private server configuration files and should NOT be shared publicly.**

## Files:

- `.env.server` - Production server environment variables
- `SERVER_SETUP.md` - Private server setup documentation  
- `fix_server.sh` - Server maintenance scripts

## Usage:

These files are used for production deployment on private infrastructure. 
For development setup, use the files in the `examples/` folder instead.

## Security:

- Never commit these files to public repositories
- Keep server credentials secure
- Use environment-specific configurations
